The films are joined together by clever faux trailers that recall the '50s exploitation drive-in classics.","Language":"English, Spanish","Country":"USA","Awards":"7 wins & 15 nominations.","Poster":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMjA0MzExNzc3MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODAxMzM0MQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Metascore":"77","imdbRating":"7.6","imdbVotes":"152,661","imdbID":"tt0462322","Type":"movie","Response":"True"}
